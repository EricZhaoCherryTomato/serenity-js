If this assumption turns out to be incorrect (because of the network being slow for instance), your test might result in false negatives. Please try to use ActiveWait instead as it's less prone to assumption-related issues ;-)\nWhy did I introduce PassiveWait then? Because it's useful with things such as CSS3 animations.\nActiveWait\nTo make your test wait using an ActiveWait (so actively polling the app until the condition is met):\nactor.attemptsTo(\n  Wait.until(InboxNavigation.Compose_Button, Is.clickable()),\n  Click.on(InboxNavigation.Compose_Button)\n)\n\nTo specify the maximum timeout:\nactor.attemptsTo(\n  Wait.upTo(Duration.seconds(10)).until(InboxNavigation.Compose_Button, Is.clickable()),\n  Click.on(InboxNavigation.Compose_Button)\n)\n\nYou might also want to check out the Is class to see what conditions are already defined and find inspiration to write some of your own.\nHope you find the new features useful!\nJan\nMany thanks to @npryce for suggesting to introduce the Duration class ✋ \n0.7.1 (2016-12-24)\nBug Fixes\n\nspec: Tests under ./spec and executed via ts-node; corrected the typings (242db610)\n\n0.7.0 (2016-12-21)\nBug Fixes\n\ntypescript: Corrected how a JS dependency is imported into TS code (87c2d80d)\n\nFeatures\n\ninteractions: Multi-value Select interaction and question (81fdb453)\n\n0.6.4 (2016-12-06)\nBug Fixes\n\ndependencies: Updated the shrinkwrap so that the new deps are included (31fbd22d)\n\n0.6.3 (2016-12-06)\nBug Fixes\n\ncucumber: Support callback style step definitions () (4278968b, closes #8)\n\n0.6.2 (2016-11-11)\nBug Fixes\n\nprotractor: References to 'protractor/globals' changed to 'protractor' (58b11253)\n\n0.6.1 (2016-11-09)\nBug Fixes\n\nprotractor: Moved protractor to peerDependencies (ffd290bc, closes #2)\n\n0.6.0 (2016-10-03)\nFeatures\n\nprotractor: Configurable Photographer (558192da)\n\n0.5.0 (2016-09-23)\nFeatures\n\nscreenplay: WebElement Question (3c5c3b0f)\n\n0.4.1 (2016-09-19)\nBug Fixes\n\ndeps: selenium-webdriver ships with serenity/js (c310adfc)\n\n0.4.0 (2016-09-18)\nFeatures\n\nprotractor: You can Select a value and check the SelectedValue (274cabca)\n\n0.3.0 (2016-09-12)\nBug Fixes\n\nTarget: Target.of works for Targets defined using the by.id locator (e462f7a4)\nreporting: Every interaction shows up in the report (961cdf19)\n\nFeatures\n\ninteractions: BrowseTheWeb exposes actions() api, DoubleClick demonstrates it (cf2d157a)\n\n0.2.0 (2016-09-10)\nFeatures\n\nscreenplay: New Questions and Interactions (abf86116)\n\n0.1.0 (2016-09-08)\nFeatures\n\nnpm: First version of Serenity/JS is now available on NPM (d6efac7c)\n\n\nYour feedback matters!\nSuggest features and improvements on github,\nget in touch on twitter,\nand if you found Serenity/JS useful - don't forget to give it a star! ★\nStar\n"},"from-scripts-to-serenity/readme.html":{"url":"from-scripts-to-serenity/readme.html","title":"From scripts to serenity","keywords":"","body":"\n\nFrom Scripts to Serenity\nIn this series of 3 tutorials you'll learn how to write automated tests\nand generate comprehensive test execution reports \nin the context of an Angular application, exercised using \nSerenity/JS, \nCucumber, \nProtractor, \nSelenium WebDriver\nand Chai.\nYou'll learn how to set up and write test scenarios using Serenity/JS and also:\n\nwhy speaking the right language is important and why Page Objects \nare not the answer to the test script spaghetti,\nhow writing what you'd like to read can make\nan automated test easier to maintain,\nwhat to do to make the tests speak for themselves\nand communicate the state of your application better to both technical and non-technical members of your team.\n\nReady?

They need to be easy to scale to multiple projects and teams, and all this while keeping maintenance costs to a minimum.\nProtractor is a leading test automation framework for Angular applications. However, the low-level APIs it provides are not in themselves sufficient to design test automation systems that could meet the requirements of a modern business. \nIn this article, we look at the limitations of using Protractor APIs directly in your tests, and at Page Objects, a commonly-proposed way to address these limitations while introducing some new ones.\nI will be illustrating this using the TodoMVC app, a simple demo application that lets you manage a todo list in a number of JavaScript frameworks.\n\nExpressing test scenarios in business language\nMore and more teams nowadays are adopting a more collaborative approach to defining requirements, using tools like Cucumber to define executable acceptance criteria in a more human-readable form.\nCucumber scenarios are typically expressed using a high-level business language, so you won't see any mentions of clicking on buttons or entering values into fields. This helps the scenario play its role as a collaboration and documentation tool, without getting too tied down to how the application is implemented under the hood.\nFor example, imagine that you need to write an acceptance test\nof the TodoMVC app that describes how a user might add a new task to the todo list. Using Cucumber, you might write something like this:\nFeature: Add new items to the todo list\n\n  In order to avoid having to remember things that need doing\n  As a forgetful person\n  I want to be able to record what I need to do in a place where I won't forget about them\n\n  Scenario: Adding an item to a list with other items\n\n    Given that James has a todo list containing Buy some cookies, Walk the dog\n     When he adds Buy some cereal to his list\n     Then his todo list should contain Buy some cookies, Walk the dog, Buy some cereal\n\nHigh-level scenarios like the one above tend to change less frequently than the screens, fields and buttons used to implement them. This separation helps to keep the scenarios stable and the maintenance costs lower.\nFor a Cucumber scenario to become an automated test, we need to implement the Given/When/Then steps in the scenario using a programming language such as JavaScript.\n\nA Test Script\nThe most common implementation would follow what I like to call \"the scripting approach\".\nIn this style of implementation, every Cucumber step is directly mapped to a series of calls\nto low-level Protractor/WebDriver APIs:\nOne common approach would be to implement each step as a \"test script\" that makes a series of calls to low-level Protractor/WebDriver APIs:\nimport { browser, by, element, protractor } from 'protractor';\n\nexport = function todoUserSteps() {\n\n    this.Given(/^.*that (.*) has a todo list containing (.*)$/, (name: string, items: string, callback: Function) => {\n\n        browser.get('http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/');\n        browser.driver.manage().window().maximize();\n\n        listOf(items).forEach(item => {\n            element(by.id('new-todo')).sendKeys(item, protractor.Key.ENTER);\n        });\n\n        browser.driver.controlFlow().execute(callback);\n    });\n\n    this.When(/^s?he adds (.*?) to (?:his|her) list$/, (itemName: string, callback: Function) => {\n        element(by.id('new-todo'))\n            .sendKeys(itemName, protractor.Key.ENTER)\n            .then(callback);\n    });\n\n    this.Then(/^.* todo list should contain (.*?)$/, (items: string, callback: Function) => {\n        expect(element.all(by.repeater('todo in todos')).getText())\n            .to.eventually.eql(listOf(items))\n            .and.notify(callback);\n    });\n};\n\nIn the above listing, expect is a reference to the chai-as-promised\nexpect interface and listOf is a helper function\nthat converts a comma-separated string coming from cucumber into a list of strings.\nThe example is implemented in TypeScript, so if you're not familiar\nwith it yet, you might want to watch\nAnders Hejlsberg's \"Introducing TypeScript\".\nThe code shown here does separate the business steps defined in the Given/When/Then statements from the test automation code. But the implementation is not ideal, for a number of reasons:\n\nThere is a lot of duplication - for example, we add tasks to the list in both the Given and the When step definitions.\nThe low-level, detail-focused code makes it hard to see at a glance if the step definitions are actually doing their job correctly. It also makes it impossible for a non-technical business person to read and verify the logic.\nEven small changes to the screens tend to have a big impact on the test code, making it difficult for the tests to keep pace with the application.\nWhen a test suite like this expands, developers need to spend more and more time tackling the widespread duplication and keeping the test suite up to date with the application, which makes it harder and harder to add new tests for new functionality.\n\nWhat we need is a way to encapsulate and reuse some of the common parts.\n\nFirst step in the journey: the Page Object(s) Pattern\nAs Selenium WebDriver became more popular in the late 2000s, and test suites began to grow bigger, developers and testers new to browser-based test automation needed a way to address these issues. In response to this, the Selenium team proposed\nthe Page Object Pattern. This simple pattern models the user interface in terms of pages, where each page is represented by a distinct class encapsulating both the definition of the page structure and the interactions that a user can perform on that page.\nIt is worth noting that the original Page Object Pattern was later\nrefined by Martin Fowler, who proposed that instead of thinking of\nthe entire application as a set of pages, each page should be considered in terms of smaller page objects or \"widgets\"\nthat the page contained. The implementation below uses that refined version, as it makes it slightly simpler.\nLet's refactor the code from the previous example using the Page Objects pattern:\nimport { browser, by, element, protractor } from 'protractor';\n\nclass TodoList {\n    What_Needs_To_Be_Done = element(by.id('new-todo'));\n    Items = element.all(by.repeater('todo in todos'));\n\n    addATodoItemCalled(itemName: string): PromiseLike {\n        return this.What_Needs_To_Be_Done.sendKeys(itemName, protractor.Key.ENTER);\n    }\n\n    displayedItems(): PromiseLike {\n        return this.Items.getText();\n    }\n}\n\nexport = function todoUserSteps() {\n\n    let todoList = new TodoList();\n\n    this.Given(/^.*that (.*) has a todo list containing (.*)$/, (name: string, items: string, callback: Function) => {\n\n        browser.get('http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/');\n        browser.driver.manage().window().maximize();\n\n        listOf(items).forEach(item => {\n            todoList.addATodoItemCalled(item);\n        });\n\n        browser.driver.controlFlow().execute(callback);\n    });\n\n    this.When(/^s?he adds (.*?) to (?:his|her) list$/, (itemName: string, callback: Function) => {\n        todoList.addATodoItemCalled(itemName).then(() => callback());\n    });\n\n    this.Then(/^.* todo list should contain (.*?)$/, (items: string, callback: Function) => {\n        expect(todoList.displayedItems())\n            .to.eventually.eql(listOf(items))\n            .and.notify(callback);\n    });\n};\n\nAs you can see above, some of the calls to the low-level Protractor APIs, such as element and element.all,\nhave been extracted into a Page Object representing the TodoList. This change brings a number of improvements in readability and ease of maintenance:\n\nWe can start to implement the step definitions using business terms like addATodoItemCalled and displayedItems, rather than using Protractor calls like sendKeys.\nWe've introduced two meaningful variables representing\nthe elements of the TodoList we would like to interact with: What_Needs_To_Be_Done and Items.\nWe've also avoided the duplication we saw previously between the Given and the When step definitions, as both of these now call the addATodoItemCalled method of the TodoList Page Object.\n\nSince a Page Object works with two distinct concepts, there are two reasons why it might need to be changed. The page structure may have changed, or a test might need to describe a new user interaction with that page. In both cases, deliberate or unintended changes to the page object carry a risk of having a negative impact on existing tests that use it. The more interactions and page elements a given page object describes, the higher the likelihood of the problem occurring.\nPage Objects also introduce a more subtle problem. As the name implies, Page Objects reason at the level of the user interface, in terms of fields, buttons and links that the user manipulates. This affects the way you think about the application too. Instead of placing the primary focus on what the user needs to do with the application, Page Objects lead you to focus on how the user interacts with individual pages. As a result, the tests become tightly coupled to the structure of the user interface, making them more brittle and more likely to be affected by UI changes.\nEven though Page Objects reduce code duplication and encourage reuse across tests within a single project\nand a single test suite, the design falls short if we need to enable code reuse across multiple projects and teams.\nThis of course affects the scalability.\nAlso, the fact that each page object is tightly coupled to Protractor APIs: element and by -\nglobal functions that are browser instance-specific - makes it impossible to use this design \"as is\" for multi-browser\ntesting (chat systems, workflow systems, multi-player games, etc.).\nNot to mention that even after extracting a Page Object from the original test script,\nthere's still plenty of low-level Protractor/WebDriver API calls left in the Cucumber steps. They are important as they\ndeal with managing the browser window and synchronising\nWebDriver Control Flow,\nwith Cucumber callbacks, but which also cloud the business logic of the implementation.\n\nSummary\nAs you can see, even though Protractor and WebDriver are excellent test automation tools, their APIs\nare simply too low-level to express intent of the interactions with the system in business terms\nand free of implementation noise.\nThe Page Object(s) Pattern addresses some of the problems, but it falls short if what you want is a test automation\nsystem that's easy to extend, maintain and scale to multiple projects and teams.\nSo far it looks like the acceptance tests are not speaking the right language and there's an abstraction missing.\nWhich leads us onto the next article: \"Writing what you'd like to read\".\n\nYour feedback matters!\nSuggest features and improvements on github,\nget in touch on twitter,\nand if you found Serenity/JS useful - don't forget to give it a star! ★\nStar\n\n"},"from-scripts-to-serenity/writing-what-you-would-like-to-read.html":{"url":"from-scripts-to-serenity/writing-what-you-would-like-to-read.html","title":"Writing what you'd like to read","keywords":"","body":"From Scripts to Serenity: Writing what you'd like to read\nIn the previous article\nwe looked at how taking\nthe scripting approach\nto test automation can result in a code base that's brittle and difficult to maintain.\nWe've also talked about how the\nPage Object(s) pattern\nsucceeded in addressing some of those problems, but also introduced some new ones.\nIn this article we'll look at how Serenity/JS and the Screenplay Pattern can help\nus design test suites that are easier to extend, maintain and scale to meet the requirements of a modern business.\nSomething practical\nLet's look again at the Cucumber scenario we know\nfrom the previous article.\nThis time we'll automate it from the \noutside-in, while gradually introducing\nthe concepts of the Screenplay Pattern.\n PRO TIP: If you like learning by doing, clone the\ntutorial project and code along!\n$> git clone https://github.com/serenity-js/tutorial-from-scripts-to-serenity\n$> cd tutorial-from-scripts-to-serenity\n$> npm install\n$> npm test\nThe last command - npm test should tell you that there is one scenario pending.

This means we can use this step definition for any actor, \nnot just James.\nActors have their Goals, and need to perform Tasks to achieve these goals.\nIn this case, James has a highly ambitious goal to add \"Buy some cereal\" to his todo list.\nBut before he can do this, our scenario needs James to start with a todo list that already contains\na couple of items - more specifically, \"Buy some cookies\" and \"Walk the dog\":\nGiven that James has a todo list containing Buy some cookies, Walk the dog\n\nLet's make the implementation reflect this (don't worry about your editor complaining that the Start class \ndoesn't exist yet, we'll implement it in the next step):\n// features/step_definitions/todo_user.steps.ts\n\nimport { Start } from '../../spec/screenplay/tasks/start';\nimport { listOf } from '../../spec/text';\n\n// ...\n\n    let actor: Actor;\n\n    this.Given(/^.*that (.*) has a todo list containing (.*)$/, function(actorName: string, items: string, callback) {\n        actor = Actor.named(actorName);\n\n        actor.attemptsTo(\n            Start.withATodoListContaining(listOf(items))\n        );\n\n        callback();\n    });\n\n// ...\n\nNotice the code we used to actually add the initial items to the list? \nThis might be a little different to the sort of test code you have seen before:\n        actor.attemptsTo(\n            Start.withATodoListContaining(listOf(items))\n        );\nHere, rather than executing a sequence of Protractor or WebDriver calls to type into fields and click on buttons, \nwe instantiate a Task object - Start.withATodoListContaining(items) - using a naming and coding style that \nclosely mimics the domain language of our application. \nWhen you call actor.attemptsTo(...), the actor performs the sequence of tasks that you pass in as parameters. \nWhile this requires a bit of a shift in your way of thinking initially, it really helps you write code \nthat's easy to read and understand.\nLet's look at how a task like this is written.\nThe first Task\nTasks are implemented as simple TypeScript classes.\nA Task class needs to implement the Task interface, so that it can be performed by an Actor.\nLet's create a directory to store the tasks - spec/screenplay/tasks, and a start.ts file in it with\nthe following contents:\n// spec/screenplay/tasks/start.ts\n\nimport { PerformsTasks, Task } from 'serenity-js/protractor';\n\nexport class Start implements Task {\n\n    static withATodoListContaining(items: string[]) {       // static method to improve the readability\n        return new Start(items);\n    }\n\n    performAs(actor: PerformsTasks): PromiseLike {    // required by the Task interface\n        return actor.attemptsTo(                            // delegates the work to lower-level tasks\n            // todo: add each item to the Todo List\n        );\n    }\n\n    constructor(private items: string[]) {                  // constructor assigning the list of items\n    }                                                       // to a private field\n}\n\n PRO TIP: You'll find that some of the directories the below code samples refer to don't exist yet.\nPlease go ahead and create them when needed.\nBuilding a Domain-Specific Language\nWhile we could simply create new instances of the tasks and pass them to the actor to perform,\nby convention we use a static factory method so that we can write Start.withATodoListContaining(items)\nrather than new Start(items):\n    static withATodoListContaining(items: string[]) {\n        return new Start(items);\n    }\n\n\"Don't call me back\"\nSince the performAs method is required to return\na PromiseLike, thenable object, we can remove the callback from the\nCucumber step definition and make the code a bit simpler and cleaner:\n// features/step_definitions/todo_user.steps.ts\n\n// ...\n\n    let actor: Actor;\n\n    this.Given(/^.*that (.*) has a todo list containing (.*)$/, function (actorName: string, items: string) {\n        actor = Actor.named(actorName);\n\n        return actor.attemptsTo(\n            Start.withATodoListContaining(listOf(items));\n        );\n    });\n\n// ...\n\nDon't Repeat Yourself\nAll the Tasks implement a common interface - Task.  This makes them easy to reuse and compose: tasks can do their job by calling other tasks, which in turn allows you to build high-level Tasks from the lower-level ones.\nThat's exactly what we'll do next as it seems that both the first and the second step of our Cucumber scenario\nrequire James to add items to his Todo List:\nGiven that James has a todo list containing Buy some cookies, Walk the dog\n When he adds Buy some cereal to his list\n\nLet's expand our vocabulary of custom Tasks then. First, write the code you'd like to have in the Cucumber step. In this case, we want to add a todo item called 'Buys some cereal', so we could imagine a task that reads like this:\nAddATodoItem.called('Buy some cereal')\n\nUsing this task, the full step definition would look like this:\n// features/step_definitions/todo_user.steps.ts\n\nimport { AddATodoItem } from '../../spec/screenplay/tasks/add_a_todo_item';\nimport { listOf } from '../../spec/text';\n\n// ...\n\n    let actor: Actor;\n\n    // ...\n\n    this.When(/^he adds (.*?) to his list$/, (itemName: string) => {\n        return actor.attemptsTo(\n            AddATodoItem.called(itemName)\n        )\n    });\n\n// ...\n\nNow we can define the AddATodoItem Task:\n// spec/screenplay/tasks/add_a_todo_item.ts\n\nimport { PerformsTasks, Task } from 'serenity-js/protractor';\n\nexport class AddATodoItem implements Task {\n\n    static called(itemName: string) {                       // static method to improve the readability\n        return new AddATodoItem(itemName);\n    }\n\n    performAs(actor: PerformsTasks): PromiseLike {    // required by the Task interface\n        return actor.attemptsTo(                            // delegates the work to lower-level tasks\n            // todo: interact with the UI\n        );\n    }\n\n    constructor(private itemName: string) {                 // constructor assigning the name of the item\n    }                                                       // to a private field\n}\n\nAnd now that we have the AddATodoItem, we can reuse it in the original Start Task:\n// spec/screenplay/tasks/start.ts\n\nimport { PerformsTasks, Task } from 'serenity-js/protractor';\nimport { AddATodoItem } from './add_a_todo_item';\n\nexport class Start implements Task {\n\n    static withATodoListContaining(items: string[]) {\n        return new Start(items);\n    }\n\n    performAs(actor: PerformsTasks): PromiseLike {\n        return actor.attemptsTo(\n            ...this.addAll(this.items)                          // ``...` is a spread operator,\n        );                                                      // which converts a list to vararg\n    }\n\n    constructor(private items: string[]) {\n    }\n\n    private addAll(items: string[]): Task[] {                   // transforms a list of item names\n        return items.map(item => AddATodoItem.called(item));    // into a list of Tasks\n    }\n}\n\nNow that we have a seed of a nice and readable Domain-Specific Language,\nit's time to make our acceptance test interact with the application.\nInteracting with the system\nIn order for James to be able to interact with the TodoMVC app,\nwe need to give him the ability to use a web browser:\nActor.named('James').whoCan(BrowseTheWeb.using(protractor.browser));\n\nIn the example above, BrowseTheWeb is an Ability,\nwhich enables James to interact\nwith protractor.browser object and therefore with the web interface of the application.\nWhy do we need this indirection here? Why not use the global protractor.browser object directly\nin our code? First of all, making the dependency on protractor.browser explicit makes our intent more obvious to the reader. Secondly, it enables multi-browser testing of applications like chat systems, workflow systems or multi-player games. We'll talk about it more in future articles.\n PRO TIP: Thanks to the Abilities, you can teach the Actors to use different interfaces of your system. For example,\nyou could imagine using a REST API to set up the test data,\nweb UI to perform the test and maybe then FTP to a server to see if the image was correctly uploaded.\nLet's update the Cucumber step definitions to include our new code:\n// features/step_definitions/todo_user.steps.ts\n\nimport { Actor, BrowseTheWeb } from 'serenity-js/protractor';\n\nimport { protractor } from 'protractor';\n\n// ...\n\nexport = function todoUserSteps() {\n\n    let actor: Actor;\n\n    this.Given(/^.*that (.*) has a todo list containing (.*)$/, (actorName: string, items: string) => {\n\n        actor = Actor.named(actorName).whoCan(BrowseTheWeb.using(protractor.browser));\n\n        return actor.attemptsTo(\n            Start.withATodoListContaining(listOf(items))\n        );\n    });\n\n    // ...\n};\n\nNow that James has the ability to interact with the application, it's time to use it.\nLet's wire up the Start task first and make it do something useful. Opening the browser and navigating\nto the application could be a good start:\n// ...\n\nimport { Open } from 'serenity-js/protractor';\n\nexport class Start implements Task {\n\n    // ...\n\n    performAs(actor: PerformsTasks): PromiseLike {\n        return actor.attemptsTo(\n            Open.browserOn('/examples/angularjs/'),\n            ...this.addAll(this.items)                          // ``...` is a spread operator,\n        );                                                      // which converts a list to vararg\n    }\n\n    // ...\n}\n\nIf you've been coding along, you can see for yourself that the browser is really being used here\nto navigate to the TodoMVC app by running npm test:\n$> npm test\nHow did that work?\nOpen is an Interaction, which means that is uses an Ability,\nin this case to BrowseTheWeb, to interact with the system.\nOpen is one of the\nInteractions that ship with Serenity/JS.\nAdding items\nNow that we can open the browser and navigate to the application it's time to add some items to the list.\nAs this interaction requires us to enter some text into the text field and hit the enter key,\nwe can use another built-in Interaction - Enter:\n// spec/screenplay/tasks/add_a_todo_item.ts\n\nimport { Enter, PerformsTasks, Task } from 'serenity-js/protractor';\n\nimport { protractor } from 'protractor';\n\nimport { TodoList } from '../components/todo_list';\n\nexport class AddATodoItem implements Task {\n\n    static called(itemName: string) {\n        return new AddATodoItem(itemName);\n    }\n\n    performAs(actor: PerformsTasks): PromiseLike {\n        return actor.attemptsTo(\n            Enter.theValue(this.itemName)                   // enter the value of the item name\n                .into(TodoList.What_Needs_To_Be_Done)       // into a \"What needs to be done\" field\n                .thenHit(protractor.Key.ENTER)              // then hit enter...\n        );\n    }                                                       // see? we didn't even need this explanation!\n\n    constructor(private itemName: string) {\n    }\n}\n\nThere's one thing missing though: we haven't defined what TodoList.What_Needs_To_Be_Done means. Let's do this next:\n// spec/screenplay/components/todo_list.ts\n\nimport { Target } from 'serenity-js/protractor';\nimport { by } from 'protractor';\n\nexport class TodoList {\n    static What_Needs_To_Be_Done = Target.the('\"What needs to be done?\" input box')\n                                         .located(by.id('new-todo'));\n}\n\nThe TodoList class is the Screenplay equivalent of a Page Object - it encapsulates all the information you need to locate elements on a screen or on a component that appears on the screen. In this case, the TodoList is responsible for knowing how to find the HTML elements that make up the todo list in the TodoMVC application.\nAnother thing that you've probably noticed is the Target object.\nA Target is a light-weight wrapper around Protractor and WebDriver Locators.\nby.id('new-todo') represents such a locator, identifying an input field by its id attribute:\n\n\nThe difference between a Target and a Locator is that a Target can be given a meaningful description,\nsuch as \"What needs to be done?\" input box or Default payment method etc.\nThis helps to generate narrative reports we'll talk about in the next tutorial. It also helps with diagnosing application\nfailures.\nIf you run the test now you'll notice that both the first and the second step of our original scenario\nhave now started to work and interact with the application, adding items to the Todo List:\n$> npm test\n Because we've designed our test system from outside-in,\ncomposing high-level tasks such as Start from lower-level ones,\nsuch as AddATodoItem, we only had to implement the change in one place.\nAsking the right Questions\nOur test scenario will be much more useful when we add an assertion to it.\nWhat we'll do next is check if the items are getting added correctly to the list.\nIn order to verify the state of the application, an Actor can ask Questions:\n// features/step_definitions/todo_user.steps.ts\n\nimport { expect } from '../../spec/expect';\nimport { TodoList } from '../../spec/screenplay/components/todo_list';\n\n// ...\n\nexport = function todoUserSteps() {\n\n    let actor: Actor;\n\n    // ...\n\n    this.Then(/^.* todo list should contain (.*?)$/, (items: string) => {\n        return expect(actor.toSee(TodoList.Items_Displayed)).eventually.deep.equal(listOf(items));\n    });\n};\n\nA Question is similar to an Interaction,\nas it uses the actor's ability to interact with the system.\nWhen the actor answers a question, it returns a Promise,\nwhich resolves to a value, such as a string of text or a number, which then can be asserted on.\nThat's why in the example above we could use Actor.toSee(question) together with chai.js\nand chai-as-promised.\nThere are several Questions that ship with Serenity/JS\nwhich you can use in your test scenarios.\nRight now we'll use Text,\nwhich returns the text value of an element - Text.of() or elements - Text.ofAll()\nidentified by a Target, and the Target itself\n// spec/screenplay/components/todo_list.ts\n\nimport { Target, Text } from 'serenity-js/protractor';\n\nexport class TodoList {\n    static What_Needs_To_Be_Done = Target.the('\"What needs to be done?\" input box')\n                                         .located(by.id('new-todo'));\n\n\n    static Items = Target.the('List of Items').located(by.repeater('todo in todos'));\n    static Items_Displayed = Text.ofAll(TodoList.Items);\n}\n\nAs with Abilities, Tasks and Interactions, you can also define custom, domain-specific Questions\nand we'll talk about the ways to do that in future articles.\n PRO TIP: In the above example, we've defined both the questions and the targets in\na single TodoList class, which represents the UI component that we're working with.\nMost of the modern UI frameworks such as Angular or React use a similar concept to represent \nan independent \"widget\" that a user can interact with.\nYou can run the test again and see the scenario succeed:\n$> npm test\nBefore you go\nTo see what happens when a scenario fails, you can add a new one to the feature file and call npm test again:\n# features/add_new_items.feature\n\n# ...\n\n  Scenario: Adding an item and failing\n    Given that James has a todo list containing Walk the dog\n     When he adds Buy some cereal to his list\n     Then his todo list should contain Herd the cats, Buy a cake\n\nThis execution should result in a message notifying you that the test has failed, accompanied by a lengthy stack trace.\nAs reading through stack traces is not necessarily the most efficient way to diagnose failures,\nthe next tutorial will focus on generating narrative, illustrated and meaningful reports of our interaction with the app.\nReady? Time to make the tests speak for themselves\n\nYour feedback matters!\nSuggest features and improvements on github,\nget in touch on twitter,\nand if you found Serenity/JS useful - don't forget to give it a star! ★\nStar\n\n"},"from-scripts-to-serenity/making-the-tests-speak-for-themselves.html":{"url":"from-scripts-to-serenity/making-the-tests-speak-for-themselves.html","title":"Making the tests speak for themselves","keywords":"","body":"From Scripts to Serenity: Making the tests speak for themselves\nIn the last tutorial\nwe looked at the basics of writing acceptance tests that are focused, readable and free of\naccidental complexity.\nThose characteristics make even the most sophisticated test suites easy to understand, maintain and extend.\nWe've also introduced the concepts behind the Screenplay Pattern,\nan innovative new way of designing automated test systems.\nIn this article, we'll look at ways of making the results of the tests visible and accessible\nto everyone on the team. Including the guys sponsoring our projects.\nRecording the interactions\n PRO TIP: If you like learning by doing, you can continue to work on the code we wrote as part of\nthe last tutorial\nor grab a fresh copy\nfrom the 1-first-scenario-implemented\nbranch.\n$> git clone https://github.com/serenity-js/tutorial-from-scripts-to-serenity\n$> cd tutorial-from-scripts-to-serenity\n$> git checkout 1-first-scenario-implemented\nTo help Serenity/JS produce those narrative, illustrated reports that anyone on the team can read and understand, \nwe first need to tell the library a bit more about the life cycle of the scenarios we execute.\nTo do this, it's enough to replace the original test framework adapter \nyou can find in the protractor.conf.json with serenity-js:\nexports.config = {\n    // Framework definition - tells Protractor to use Serenity/JS\n    framework: 'custom',\n    frameworkPath: require.resolve('serenity-js')\n}\n\nWhen you run the tests again:\n$> npm test\nyou'll notice that a new directory was created and that it contains a .json\nfile in it, together with a couple of .png files:\n$> ls target/site/serenity\n\n704ff39d93ac1503afb0ba8a5ad03c71.json\nSerenity/JS produces one JSON file per each test scenario executed. \nThose JSON files are then analysed and aggregated by Serenity BDD in a separate step\nto produce a HTML report. We'll look into the details of this process next.\nBut getting the test execution recorded is not the only thing that we managed to accomplish \nby changing this one, humble line:\nframeworkPath: require.resolve('serenity-js')\n\nTo fully appreciate the benefits of this change, we need to talk a bit more about the inner workings of WebDriver JS.\nIt's all about... timing!\nWebDriver JavaScript API, and therefore Protractor API, is entirely asynchronous. \nThis means that whenever we issue a call to click on a button, or enter a value into a field, we trigger an asynchronous operation.\nBecause those operations are asynchronous, we need some way to ensure that they're executed in a correct order.\nThis could be achieved using either promises or callbacks, but because WebDriver JS has been around long before Node.js \ncould support promises natively with async/await, promise chaining was difficult to embrace for the newcomers,\nand the traditional Node.js-style callbacks were not such an attractive option, WebDriver has found a different way.\nIn the effort to make working with asynchronous operations easier for developers new to JavaScript,\nWebDriver implements its own Promise Manager,\nalso known as the Control Flow,\nwhich takes over the execution of those asynchronous calls from Node.js, \nreplacing the built-in mechanisms\nand makes them look like if they were synchronous operations:\nlet addTodo = element(by.model('todoList.todoText'));\nlet addButton = element(by.css('[value=\"add\"]'));\n\naddTodo.sendKeys('write a test');       // schedules an async operation\naddButton.click();                      // same here\n\nRegretfully, even though on the surface this design makes writing tests seem easier, it comes at a cost of making \nboth debugging and integration with other tools much more difficult. This problem has \nbeen recently recognised by the Selenium \nTeam, who are planning to completely deprecate the Promise Manager\nby October 2018 in favour of using native promises.\nUntil then, since most tools such as Cucumber.js or Chai.js\nare not WebDriver-aware (nor should they be), those two approaches to dealing with the asynchronous nature of JavaScript\nneed to be reconciled. \nIf this problem is not addressed, different parts of our testing framework would operate on different schedules - \ntools other than WebDriver could think that a given interaction is completed when in fact it's \nonly been scheduled for execution.\nIf proper care is not taken, this dichotomy leads to inaccurate and often incorrect reports produced by\nthe Protractor/Cucumber combo, with step duration reported incorrectly and errors reported as occurring in steps \nfurther down the execution chain than where they actually have happened.\nThankfully, one other benefit of using Serenity/JS as a mediator between Protractor and Cucumber (or Mocha) \nis promise synchronisation. This means that you can use box-standard JavaScript promises \nand promise-based libraries without having to worry about the internal WebDriver mechanism.\n PRO TIP: You can improve the reporting and correct the synchronisation on an existing project\nby introducing Serenity/JS with just a single-line of code. \nAnd you can do this even before you start using TypeScript or the Screenplay Pattern! \nFrom JSON to HTML\nThe HTML report is much more than just a sum of its parts.\nThe aggregate contains of course the detailed results of each test scenario,\nbut it can also contain information about the capabilities and features of your system that the tests have covered\nand more importantly - the capabilities and features that the tests have not covered yet.\nSince the HTML report presents a much richer perspective on the test results,\nits generation is more demanding computationally.\nFor this reason, it happens separately from the test execution phase.\nHowever, there are other practical advantages on top the positive performance implications of this design:\n\nSince the JSON reports produced by Serenity/JS are compatible with the ones produced\nby Serenity BDD for Java, you can have Serenity/JS and Serenity BDD produce the intermediate\nJSON reports independently and then aggregate them together to have a single report covering several projects\nBecause Serenity/JS produces a JSON file per test scenario, you can shard the execution of tests to multiple\nservers, collect the intermediate reports and aggregate them at a later stage\nof a Continuous Delivery pipeline\n\nManaging dependencies\nThe component responsible for analysing and aggregating the intermediate reports is Serenity BDD itself,\nwhich is a Java library and therefore requires a Java Runtime Environment 7 or newer.\nTo verify that you have Java 7 or newer installed, run:\n$> java -version\n\njava version \"1.8.0_25\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_25-b17)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.25-b02, mixed mode)\nTo make invoking a Java program from Node.js easier,\nwe'll need a new dependency - serenity-cli:\n$> npm install serenity-cli --save-dev\n PRO TIP: Even though serenity-cli is a command line program, we're installing it in the scope\nof the current project rather than globally.\nThis way we can make the dependency on the package explicit and its version under control,\nwhich wouldn't be possible with a globally installed module.\nScripting the installation\nserenity-cli delegates all the analysis and aggregation work to the Serenity BDD jar,\nwhich means that it needs to download it first.\nThe downloading of the jar is a one time process as the jar gets cached in the node_modules directory.\nThis behaviour is similar to how Protractor\nmanages the WebDriver jar\nas well as other browser-specific driver binaries, such as chromedriver.\nTo make sure that the jar is downloaded when needed, add \"pretest\": \"serenity update\" to the scripts\nsection of the package.json:\n// package.json\n\n// ...\n\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"pretest\": \"serenity update\",\n\n    //...\n  },\n\n// ...\n\nThe pretest is an NPM script, which will be invoked before the npm test\ncommand is executed.\nWhen you call npm test with the new script in place, you should see the output similar to the following:\n$> npm test\n\ninfo: Looks like you need the latest Serenity BDD CLI jar. Let me download it for you...\ninfo: Downloaded to /Users/jan/tutorial-from-scripts-to-serenity/node_modules/serenity-cli/.cache/serenity-cli-0.0.1-rc.3-all.jar\nScripting the reporting\nWith the Serenity BDD CLI jar in place, we can now use it to produce the aggregated report. To do this, let's add\nanother NPM script - \"report\": \"serenity run\":\n// package.json\n\n// ...\n\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"pretest\": \"serenity update\",\n    \"report\":  \"serenity run\",\n\n    //...\n  },\n\n// ...\n\nWe can now execute both scripts in a sequence to see the HTML report we've been waiting for:\n$> npm test\n$> npm run report\n PRO TIP: As opposed to test and pretest, report is not a standard NPM script.\nYou can invoke any custom scripts using the npm run  syntax, which is what we just did.\nThe result of executing the npm run report is a static HTML page, generated under target/site/serenity.\nInside that directory you'll notice the index.html file, which opened in a web browser should present a report similar\nto the one below:\n\nStarting fresh each time\nIn order to avoid having reports from previous test executions lying around, we need to make sure that\nthe target directory is empty before executing the suite.\nTo create the script that does it for us, install the rimraf module:\n$> npm install rimraf --save-dev\nand define a clean script:\n// package.json\n\n// ...\n\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"clean\":   \"rimraf target\",\n    \"pretest\": \"serenity update\",\n    \"report\":  \"serenity run\",\n\n    //...\n  },\n\n// ...\n\nRunning npm run clean removes the target directory.\nScripting the flow\nRight now we can:\n\nexecute the test suite and produce the intermediary JSON reports - npm test\nanalyse the individual reports and produce an aggregated HTML report - npm run report\nremove the target directory, storing both JSON and HTML files before each test suite run - npm run clean\n\nIt would be much easier if instead of calling three separate commands we could just call one.\nThankfully, the npm-failsafe can help us with that:\n$> npm install npm-failsafe --save-dev\n PRO TIP: We're using the npm-failsafe module instead of the more traditional && and || operators.\nChaining the scripts using script-1 && script-2 syntax won't execute script-2 should script-1\nfail - so we won't get the test report when a test fails, which is exactly when we need it the most.\nUsing script-1 || script-2 executes both scripts even if the first one fails,\nbut returns an exit code of success even when the tests fail,\nwhich confuses Continuous Integration servers.\nWith npm-failsafe installed we can modify our scripts a bit:\n// package.json\n\n// ...\n\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"clean\":   \"rimraf target\",\n    \"pretest\": \"serenity update\",\n    \"report\":  \"serenity run\",\n    \"test\":    \"failsafe clean protractor report\",\n\n    //...\n  },\n\n// ...\n\nNow running npm test will:\n\ndownload the Serenity BDD CLI jar and cache it if it's needed\nclean the target directory\nexecute the tests\ngenerate the HTML report\n\nNarrative reports\nOpening the HTML report and navigating to the details of our test scenario should present a view similar to the one below:\n\nAs you can see, each Cucumber step is presented together with all the interactions that have contributed to making it happen.\nThat's very useful, but the Interactions are pretty low-level and all speak using the vocabulary\nof the solution domain (\"clicking buttons\" and \"entering values into fields\") rather than the business domain\n(\"adding items to the list\", \"paying with a default credit card\" and so on). Let's improve that now.\nHead back to the Start Task we have created as part of our last tutorial and add a @step annotation,\ngiving the Task a more descriptive name:\n// spec/screenplay/tasks/start.ts\n\nimport { Open, PerformsTasks, step, Task } from 'serenity-js/protractor';     // imports the @step\n\nimport { AddATodoItem } from './add_a_todo_item';\n\nexport class Start implements Task {\n\n    static withATodoListContaining(items: string[]) {\n        return new Start(items);\n    }\n\n    @step('{0} starts with a Todo List containing #items')      // Gives the Task a more descriptive name\n    performAs(actor: PerformsTasks): PromiseLike {\n        return actor.attemptsTo(\n            Open.browserOn('/examples/angularjs/'),\n            ...this.addAll(this.items)\n        );\n    }\n\n    constructor(private items: string[]) {\n    }\n\n    private addAll(items: string[]): Task[] {\n        return items.map(item => AddATodoItem.called(item));\n    }\n}\n\n PRO TIP: @step annotation can process tokens, which can be defined as:\n\n{0}, where 0 means the 0-th argument the performAs method was invoked with - the actor in our case\n#member, where member means any private or public field or method of the Task object - here it's the items field\n\nNow, repeat the process with the AddATodoItem task:\n// spec/screenplay/tasks/add_a_todo_item.ts\n\nimport { Enter, PerformsTasks, step, Task } from 'serenity-js/protractor';\n\nimport { protractor } from 'protractor';\n\nimport { TodoList } from '../components/todo_list';\n\nexport class AddATodoItem implements Task {\n\n    static called(itemName: string) {\n        return new AddATodoItem(itemName);\n    }\n\n    @step('{0} adds a Todo Item called #itemName')              // Gives the Task a more descriptive name\n    performAs(actor: PerformsTasks): PromiseLike {\n        return actor.attemptsTo(\n            Enter.theValue(this.itemName)\n                .into(TodoList.What_Needs_To_Be_Done)\n                .thenHit(protractor.Key.ENTER)\n        );\n    }\n\n    constructor(private itemName: string) {\n    }\n}\n\nAnd run the test suite again to see that the scenario report now also mentions all the business-level tasks:\n$> npm test\n\nAn image is worth a thousand words\nIn the beginning I promised that the reports will not only be narrative but also illustrated.\nThe design of the Serenity/JS library uses a system metaphor\nof a stage performance (the name of the Screenplay Pattern is a prime example of that).\nThis means that in order to add pictures to the reports we need to invite a Photographer \nto join the Stage Crew.\nSince taking screenshots is such a common requirement however, the Photographer is assigned to a stage crew by default,\nthis means that the following configuration:\nexports.config = {\n\n    framework: 'custom',\n    frameworkPath: require.resolve('serenity-js')\n\n    cucumberOpts: {\n        // ..\n    }\n}\n\ncould be also written as:\nconst crew = require('serenity-js/lib/stage_crew');\n\nexports.config = {\n\n    framework: 'custom',\n    frameworkPath: require.resolve('serenity-js')\n\n    serenity: {\n        crew:    [\n            crew.serenityBDDReporter(),\n            crew.photographer()\n        ]\n    },\n\n    cucumberOpts: {\n        // ..\n    }\n}\n\n PRO TIP: You can learn more about the configuration options from the further chapters.\nA Photographer will take a photo of whichever actor is in the spotlight, as soon as the Actor performs an activity\nof interest to the Photographer.\nSo where's this whole spotlight I'm talking about? It doesn't seem like we have it yet, and if we don't, how come can we\ncapture the screenshots?\nThe same mechanism that helps to introduce Serenity/JS to an existing project\nis at play here. If a project does not make use of actors, Serenity/JS associates the global protractor.browser with \na generic, \"stand-in actor\" so that you can get the screenshots even before you have the actors, \nthe stage, or anything even remotely related to those concepts.\nBecause of this, and the fact that the actor we defined also happens to be using the very same, default protractor browser,\none can be associated with the other automatically.\nLet's introduce the stage and this association a bit more obvious though.\nShining the spotlight\nIn order to have the Actor in a Spotlight, we need to have the Stage first,\nso let's make the following changes to the todo_user.steps.ts:\n// features/step_definitions/todo_user.steps.ts\n\nimport { Actor, BrowseTheWeb } from 'serenity-js/protractor';\nimport { protractor } from 'protractor';\nimport { serenity } from 'serenity-js';\n\nimport { Start, AddATodoItem } from '../../spec/screenplay/tasks';\nimport { listOf } from '../../spec/text';\nimport { expect } from '../../spec/expect';\nimport { TodoList } from '../../spec/screenplay/components/todo_list';\n\nexport = function todoUserSteps() {\n\n    let stage = Serenity.callToStageFor({\n        actor: (name) => Actor.named(name).whoCan(BrowseTheWeb.using(protractor.browser))\n    });\n\n    this.Given(/^.*that (.*) has a todo list containing (.*)$/, function (name: string, items: string) {\n        return stage.theActorCalled(name).attemptsTo(\n            Start.withATodoListContaining(listOf(items))\n        );\n    });\n\n    this.When(/^s?he adds (.*?) to (?:his|her) list$/, function (itemName: string) {\n        return stage.theActorInTheSpotlight().attemptsTo(\n            AddATodoItem.called(itemName)\n        )\n    });\n\n    this.Then(/^.* todo list should contain (.*?)$/, function (items: string) {\n        return expect(stage.theActorInTheSpotlight().toSee(TodoListItems.Displayed))\n            .eventually.deep.equal(listOf(items))\n    });\n};\n\nAs you can see above, instead of instantiating the Actor directly, we delegate this job to the Stage class:\n\nstage.theActorCalled(name) creates a new Actor via the\n(name) => Actor.named(name)... function and remembers it\nas the \"Actor in the Spotlight\"\nstage.theActorInTheSpotlight() retrieves the last active Actor\n\nWe'll look in detail into how the Stage works in the future tutorials when we talk about multi-actor testing.\nFor now, since we have both the Stage and the Stage Crew assigned to it, we can again run the tests:\n$> npm test\n PRO TIP: Defining the stage as a local variable is sufficient when the project has only one \nstep definition library (the \"steps file\") that cucumber needs to load. \nIn more complex scenarios you might want to\nmake the stage available on the cucumber context\nto avoid duplication.\nSummary\nBy organising the code of our automated acceptance testing system\nto follow the Screenplay Pattern\nand adding @step annotations to the business-level tasks, we managed to generate meaningful, narrative and illustrated\nreports that can form part of the living documentation\nof our application and help facilitate better communication between the members of the project team.\nWould you like to learn more about working with Cucumber?\n\nYour feedback matters!\nSuggest features and improvements on github,\nget in touch on twitter,\nand if you found Serenity/JS useful - don't forget to give it a star!

(see above)\n\n    specs: [ 'spec/**/*.spec.ts' ],\n\n    mochaOpts: {\n        ui:       'bdd',                  // use the describe/it syntax (default: 'bdd').\n        compiler: 'ts:ts-node/register'   // interpret step definitions as TypeScript\n    }\n}\n\n PRO TIP: Mocha's programmatic API does not accept the compiler option, and because of that the above configuration \nwould not work with Protractor's built-in Mocha adapter. \nSerenity/JS interprets the compiler configuration and loads the required module using syntax consistent with Cucumber's\nand Mocha's command line interface.\nAs with Cucumber, note that even though the configuration above tells Mocha to use a TypeScript transpiler to interpret \nthe spec files (compiler: 'ts:ts-node/register'), it works perfectly fine with specs defined in JavaScript too\n(see mixed mode):\nexports.config = {\n\n    // Framework definition - tells Protractor to use Serenity/JS\n    // ... (see above)\n\n    specs: [                    // load specs defined in:\n        'spec/**/*.spec.ts',    // - TypeScript\n        'spec/**/*.spec.js'     // - JavaScript\n     ],\n\n    mochaOpts: {\n        ui:       'bdd',\n        compiler: 'ts:ts-node/register'   // interpret step definitions as TypeScript\n    }\n}\n\nLearn more about writing and executing test scenarios using Mocha.\nSerenity/JS - dialect\nSerenity/JS detects whether you want to use Cucumber or Mocha based on the presence of cucumberOpts or mochaOpts,\nrespectively.\nYou can skip the automatic detection and define which dialect to use by specifying the dialect option \nin the serenity section of your configuration:\nexports.config = {\n\n    serenity: {\n        dialect: 'cucumber',  // or 'mocha'\n    }\n    // ...\n}\n\nStage Crew Members\nThe Stage Crew Members listen on\nand act upon the domain events\nemitted during the test scenario execution.\nYour default stage crew consists of:\n\nthe Photographer, who takes a screenshot of the UI when an actor performs a task\nthe SerenityBDDReporter, who produces Serenity BDD-compatible JSON reports\n\n// Optional, imports Serenity/JS Stage Crew Members\nconst crew = require('serenity-js/lib/stage_crew');\n\nexports.config = {\n\n    // Framework definition - tells Protractor to use Serenity/JS\n    // ... (see above)\n\n    serenity: {\n        crew:    [\n            crew.serenityBDDReporter(),\n            crew.photographer()\n        ],\n\n        dialect: 'cucumber',  // or 'mocha'\n    },\n\n    // Test framework-specific configuration... (see above)\n\n    // Other protractor-specific configuration... (see below)\n}\n\nStage Crew configured via the serenity.crew property overrides the defaults, so for example if you wanted to disable\nscreenshots altogether, you can let the Photographer go and only leave the SerenityBDDReporter:\nserenity: {\n    crew:    [\n        crew.serenityBDDReporter(),\n    ]\n}\n\nIf you wanted to see what tasks are being performed, but were not interested in producing the report, you could hire \nthe ConsoleReporter instead of the default Crew   :\nserenity: {\n    crew:    [\n        crew.consoleReporter(),\n    ]\n}\n\n PRO TIP: You can define your own Stage Crew Members to produce custom reports or integrate \nwith your infrastructure.\nRequirements directory\nBy default, Serenity/JS assumes that your acceptance tests, in the form of either \nCucumber *.feature files \nor Mocha *.spec.ts files, \nare kept in the features directory under the project root.\nIt also assumes that you run your acceptance tests from the project's root directory. \nThis means that the default configuration of the requirementsDirectory looks as follows,\nbut you can change it to better fit the structure of your project: \nserenity: {\n    requirementsDirectory: `${process.cwd()}/features`\n}\n\nOutput directory\nSerenity/JS produces .json reports (optionally accompanied by screenshots)\nand stores them in the target/site/serenity directory (relative to where you're executing the tests from)\nwhere they can be processed by Serenity BDD CLI\nto create the HTML reports.\nThis means that the default configuration of the outputDirectory looks as follows, but you can change it \nto better fit the structure of your project:\nserenity: {\n    outputDirectory: `${process.cwd()}/target/site/serenity/`\n}\n\n PRO TIP: To configure a location that's relative to your current working directory (i.e. where you execute\nyour test runner, such as Protractor) use process.cwd(), \nfor example: ${process.cwd()}/some/relative/path.\nThe thing to remember when changing the default output directory, though, is that this will also require you to tell\nSerenity BDD CLI where to look for the reports.\nTo do this, make sure that you specify the --source and --destination parameters \nwhen invoking serenity run:\nserenity run --source my/custom/path --destination my/custom/path\nTo find out more about the command line options of Serenity CLI run:\nserenity --help run\n PRO TIP: The serenity script mentioned above lives under the node_modules/.bin directory,\nso you can either execute it there, or add a script to your package.json: scripts: { serenity: \"serenity\" }\nand run it through the npm: npm run serenity --help run. \nTimeouts\nTo ensure that the contract with Protractor\nis respected, Serenity/JS needs to wait for any Protractor plugins to process the results of a finished scenario\nbefore the next scenario can be executed. The same synchronisation needs to occur if Serenity/JS is configured \nto capture screenshots, as those too might take some time to be stored to disk, \nespecially when the web browser is hosted on a remote grid.\nTo handle those situations, a test scenario will wait for a signal to start - a stage cue,\nup to the maximum of serenity.stageCueTimeout milliseconds: \nserenity: {\n   stageCueTimeout: 30 * 1000   // up to 30 seconds by default\n}\n\nTo learn how to configure other timeouts, consult the below sections of relevant manuals:\n\nProtractor Timeouts\nCucumber Timeouts\nMocha Timeouts\n\nProtractor\nThe rest of the configuration can be defined as per \nthe Protractor documentation.\nMixed mode\nThanks to the fact that TypeScript is a super-set of JavaScript, valid JavaScript code is, in fact, valid TypeScript, \njust without the benefit of type definitions.\nWhat this means is that Cucumber can use step definitions and Mocha can execute specs where some of them are implemented \nin TypeScript and some in JavaScript, yet they can still co-exist in the same codebase without a problem.\nThis fact is incredibly useful when introducing Serenity/JS and TypeScript to an existing JavaScript codebase,\nbecause it allows for gradual and safe adoption of Serenity/JS, rather than a big-bang re-write.\nTypeScript\nThe ts-node module, \nthe one responsible for interpreting the TypeScript sources in-memory, \nuses the same configuration file\nas the regular TypeScript compiler.\nThe easiest thing to do to make sure that the TypeScript code you write is transpiled correctly \nis to place a tsconfig.json file with the below contents \nin the root directory of your Node.js project, the same place where the protractor.conf.js file lives:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"lib\": [ \"es5\", \"es6\" ],\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n    \"emitDecoratorMetadata\": true,\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true,\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"declaration\": true\n  },\n\n  \"exclude\": [\n    \"node_modules\"\n  ]\n}\n\n\nYour feedback matters!\nSuggest features and improvements on github,\nget in touch on twitter,\nand if you found Serenity/JS useful -

the Flying High Airlines (more on this example in \n\"BDD in Action\").\n PRO TIP: In the above example listing, both the application code (src) and the test code (spec) live in \nthe same repository.\nHaving both the production and the test code base in the same place is beneficial as it encourages both developers\nand testers to keep the test scenarios up to date with the application features.\nExample\nFlying High Airlines would like to encourage traveller loyalty through some sort of a reward system. \nA Frequent Flyer Programme could enable the travellers to earn points whenever they book with the airline.\nThe points earned this way could be then spent on flight upgrades.\nLet's look at how some of the example scenarios illustrating the features delivering this capability \ncould be formulated.\n\nCapabilities don’t imply any particular implementation. \nFor example, “the ability to book a flight” could be provided online, over the phone, or at counter at the airport.\n\nIn our example, the capability we want to enable is to let the travellers earn the Frequent Flyer points.\nThe name of the capability becomes the name of the directory under features:\n├── features\n│   ├── earning_frequent_flyer_points  \n│   │   └── ...\n│   ├── spending_frequent_flyer_points\n│   │   └── ...\n│   └── ...\n└── ...\n PRO TIP: You might have noticed that the above directory structure differs from \na box-standard Cucumber implementation\nas it allows you to group features by the capabilities they deliver.\nThis has several advantages:\n\nimproved discoverability and understandability\nimproved reporting - understanding what features deliver what capabilities enables you to better assess the health \nand release readiness of your system.\n\n\nFeatures are pieces of deliverable software functionality, \nsuch as an “Online Frequent Flyer account summary.” Features deliver the capabilities.\n\nOne of the features delivering the above capability could be for travellers to earn \nFrequent Flyer Points when they book domestic flights.\nThe description of a feature is stored in a .feature file, such as this one:\nFeature: Earning Frequent Flyer points on domestic flights\n\n  In order to encourage travellers to book with Flying High Airlines more frequently\n  As the Flying High sales manager\n  I want travellers to earn Frequent Flyer points when they fly with us on domestic flights\n\nThe .feature file is then stored under the directory describing the capability the feature delivers:\n├── features\n│   └── earning_frequent_flyer_points  \n│       ├── earning_points_on_domestic_flights.feature\n│       └── ...\n└── ...\n\nExample Scenarios  illustrate how a feature works, \nsuch as “Account summary should display a list of recently earned points.”\n\nExample scenarios are expressed using \nthe Given/When/Then syntax,\nand stored together with the description of the feature in the .feature file:\nFeature: Earning Frequent Flyer points on domestic flights\n\n  In order to encourage travellers to book with Flying High Airlines more frequently\n  As the Flying High sales manager\n  I want travellers to earn Frequent Flyer points when they fly with us on domestic flights\n\n  Scenario: Earning standard points from an Economy flight        # example scenario 1\n\n    Given the flying distance between London and Paris is 344 km  # scenario steps\n      And I am a standard Frequent Flyer member\n     When I fly from London to Paris\n     Then I should earn 172 points\n\n  Scenario: Earning extra points in Business class                # example scenario 2\n\n    Given the flying distance between London and Paris is 344 km\n      And I am a standard Frequent Flyer member\n     When I fly from London to Paris in Business class\n     Then I should earn 344 points \n\n  # ... other scenarios illustrating the feature\n\nIf you were to run the above scenarios now, you'd notice that instead of executing the\nautomated tests, Cucumber tells you that the step definitions have not been implemented yet.\nIt'll however helpfully propose a starting point for the implementation:\n1) Scenario: Earning standard points from an Economy flight - features/earning_frequent_flyer_points/earning_points_on_domestic_flights.feature:7\n   Step: Given the flying distance between London and Paris is 344 km - features/earning_frequent_flyer_points/earning_points_on_domestic_flights.feature:8\n   Message:\n     Undefined.

It's also common to have more than one step library\nin one project, as they can be sliced by a user role: editor.steps.ts, reader.steps.ts, publisher.steps.ts, \nby component: basket.steps.ts, checkout.steps.ts and so on.\nHere, we're calling our library traveller.steps.ts to signify that it will contain step definitions related \nto a \"traveller\" role.\nThe typical structure of a step definition library looks like this:\nexport = function travellerSteps() {                                            // (1)\n\n    this.Given(/^.*the flying distance between (.*) and (.*) is (.*) km$/,      // (2)\n        function(origin: string, destination: string, distance: number) {       // (3)\n            return this.stage.theActorCalled(name).attemptsTo(                  // (4)\n                // ... perform tasks related to test data setup\n            );\n        }\n    );\n\n    this.When(/^I fly from (.*) to (.*)$/, function(origin: string, destination: string) {\n        return this.stage.theActorInTheSpotlight().attemptsTo(\n            // ... perform tasks related to booking a flight\n        );\n    });\n\n    // ...\n}\n\nThere are several important details here, so let's walk through them step by step:\n\nexport = function travellerSteps() exports a default function, making Cucumber execute the travellerSteps\nin the context of \"Cucumber Hooks\", so a call to this.Given is in fact a call to cucumberHooks.Given \n(OK, it's a bit more sophisticated\nthan that, see the Support Code section below) \nthis.Given(regularExpression, stepDefinition) registers a stepDefinition that will be executed whenever\nthe Cucumber parser finds a step matching the regularExpression\nfunction(origin: string, destination: string, distance: number) { ... } defines the actual automation code\nthat will be executed for a given step. Please note that if the steps rely\non the Cucumber context, it's important to define the step using\nthe function keyword rather than the shorter, fat arrow notation ((argument) => {}). This ensures\nthat this in (4) represents the context.\nreturn this.stage.theActorCalled(name).attemptsTo(...) invokes one of the actors to perform the tasks associated\nwith a given step and returns a Promise when the actor is done with their work \n(see the Screenplay Pattern).\n\nYou might have noticed several things:\n\nSerenity/JS encourages you to use Cucumber's Promise interface: actor.attemptsTo(/*...*/) returns \na Promise, which is then passed on to Cucumber so that it knows that when the Promise is resolved, it can execute the\nnext step. The Promise interface is much more \npowerful and cleaner than the more traditional callback interface.\nThe Given step calls this.stage.theActorCalled(name) and the When step calls this.stage.theActorInTheSpotlight().\nThis is because theActorCalled(name) initialises an actor called by name \nand puts them in the \"spotlight\" (a.k.a. remembers which actor you've initialised last). \ntheActorInTheSpotlight() simply retrieves that actor from memory. \n\nOne last thing is that we haven't defined this.stage anywhere, yet we're using it? Let's find out how this works!\n\"All the world's a stage\"\nCucumber's \"context\" is called \"the World\", and it's where the state of the Stage is stored, \nand where the this.stage property is initialised.\n\"The World\" is traditionally defined in the world.ts file and stored under features/support:\n├── features\n│   ├── capability_1\n│   ├── capability_2\n│   ├── step_definitions        \n│   └── support\n│       └── world.ts        In order to initialise \"The World\" create a file with a default exported function, same as with a step library:\nimport { serenity } from 'serenity-js';\n\nimport { protractor } from 'protractor';\nimport { Actor, BrowseTheWeb, Cast } from 'serenity-js/protractor';\n\nexport = function() {\n\n    // You can configure the default step timeout here too:\n    this.setDefaultTimeout(60 * 1000);\n\n    this.World = function() {\n        // Any properties assigned to `this` will be available to step definitions:\n        this.stage = serenity.callToStageFor(new Travellers());\n    };\n};\n\nclass Travellers implements Cast {\n    actor(name: string): Actor {\n        return Actor.named(name).whoCan(BrowseTheWeb.using(protractor.browser));\n    }\n}\n\nYou might have noticed that the Stage is initialised using a custom Cast of Actors.\nSince Serenity/JS doesn't know what you'd like your actors to do, nor what abilities they should have,\nit expects you to provide a simple factory \nit can invoke with the name of an actor coming from your test, expecting\nan instantiated Actor back.  \nLearn more about the Stage.\nSupport code\nIf you're curious how Cucumber loads all this support code, \nremember the chapter on configuration,\nwhere we have configured Cucumber to load any TypeScript and JavaScript files it can find under the features directory:\n    cucumberOpts: {\n        require:    [           // loads step definitions:\n            'features/**/*.ts', // - defined using TypeScript    \n            'features/**/*.js'  // - defined using JavaScript\n        ], \n        format:     'pretty',               // enable console output\n        compiler:   'ts:ts-node/register'   // interpret step definitions as TypeScript\n    }\n\nWhen Cucumber loads a file it checks if the file defines a default function:\nexport = function () { \n    //... \n}\n\nIf the function exists, Cucumber executes it providing itself as this. \nThat's why we can register the step definitions and the World constructor.\nYou can now give the actor some Tasks to perform\nor find out how to execute Cucumber scenarios.\n\nYour feedback matters!\nSuggest features and improvements on github,\nget in touch on twitter,\nand if you found Serenity/JS useful - don't forget to give it a star!

in executable specifications), \nnext to the src, where the application sources live.\nHowever, since Mocha can be used for both unit and functional acceptance testing, you might want to separate the\ntwo concerns and place the acceptance tests under features, \nto mimic the already familiar to you Cucumber structure\nand avoid accidentally executing one type of tests when in fact you meant the other.\nAlternatively, if you like to keep all the executable specifications in one place, you could also\nintroduce an additional level of nesting under spec, such as spec/features, but it's entirely up to you.\nTo keep it simple and consistent, let's assume that the acceptance tests for either Mocha or Cucumber should \nbe placed under features.\nExample\nTo demonstrate how Mocha and Serenity/JS can be used together, we'll use the same example you know from when \nwe talked about Cucumber earlier on.\nThis way you'll see the same test scenario in a context of two different test dialects.\nThe example draws inspiration from \"BDD in Action\" by John Ferguson Smart, author of Serenity BDD.\n\n\n\n\nAs you might recall, the feature definition that our imaginary team has arrived at looked like this:\nFeature: Earning Frequent Flyer points on domestic flights                                  (1)\n\n  In order to encourage travellers to book with Flying High Airlines more frequently        (2)\n  As the Flying High sales manager                                                          (3)\n  I want travellers to earn Frequent Flyer points when they fly with us on domestic flights (4)\n\n  Scenario: Earning standard points from an Economy flight                                  (5)\n\n    Given the flying distance between London and Paris is 344 km                            (6)\n      And I am a standard Frequent Flyer member\n     When I fly from London to Paris                                                        (7)\n     Then I should earn 172 points                                                          (8)\n\n  Scenario: Earning extra points in Business class\n\n    Given the flying distance between London and Paris is 344 km\n      And I am a standard Frequent Flyer member\n     When I fly from London to Paris in Business class\n     Then I should earn 344 points      \n\n  # and so on\n\nEven though it looks simple on the surface, this short feature file captures quite a lot of information:\n\nthe name of the feature \nthe business goal of the feature\nwho the main stakeholder is\nthe actors whose behaviour the Flying High Airlines want to influence\nthe title of the scenario\nany preconditions that need to be satisfied \naction under test\nexpected outcome\n\nSo how do we capture all of it in this?\ndescribe('a feature', () => {\n    it('has some behaviour')\n});\n\nAs Cucumber places its focus on collaborative requirements discovery and Mocha on test automation, the vocabulary\nand expressiveness of those two tools differ quite significantly.\nNevertheless, with a little help from Serenity/JS we can still make our tests \ncapture quite a lot of the domain knowledge.\n\nYour feedback matters!\nSuggest features and

to use \nthe describe and it blocks effectively so that both the scenarios and the reports\ncapture the domain knowledge and vocabulary. \nName of the feature\nSerenity/JS interprets the outer-most describe block of a Mocha test scenario as the name of the feature:\ndescribe('Earning Frequent Flyer points on domestic flights', () => {\n\n});\n\nTitle of the scenario\nThe title of the it block becomes the title of the test scenario.\ndescribe('Earning Frequent Flyer points on domestic flights', () => {\n\n    it('Flying in Economy class earns standard points', () => {\n\n    });\n});\n\nNesting scenarios\nIn fact, any nested describe blocks, together with the final it contribute to the title of the scenario.\nThis means that you can neatly group scenarios together:\ndescribe('Earning Frequent Flyer points on domestic flights', () => {\n    describe('Flying in', () => {\n        describe('Economy class', () => {\n            it('earns standard points');\n            it('earns 1.5x when travelling 8 times per month or more');\n        });\n\n        describe('Business class', () => {\n            it('earns double points');\n        });\n    });                \n});\n\nWhich will be then reported as follows:\n\n PRO TIP: Leaving out the test scenario body marks it as pending implementation rather than passing: \nit('has just the title');           // reported as pending\nit('has the body too', () => {});   // reported as passing\n\nThe stage call\nTo make the actors interact with the system under test, \nwe again need the Stage.\nWith Mocha, however, the setup is much simpler than with Cucumber, so an instance of the stage can be a simple \nconstant, defined in the scope of one of the describe blocks:\n// features/frequent_flyer_points-domestic_flights.ts\n\nimport { serenity } from 'serenity-js';\nimport { Travellers } from '../spec/screenplay/travellers.ts';\n\ndescribe('Earning Frequent Flyer points on domestic flights', () => {\n\n    const stage = serenity.callToStageFor(new Travellers());\n\n    describe('Flying in', () => {\n        describe('Economy class', () => {\n            it('earns standard points');\n            it('earns 1.5x when travelling 8 times per month or more');\n        });\n\n        describe('Business class', () => {\n            it('earns double points');\n        });\n    });                \n});\n\nWhere the Travellers are our domain-specific cast of actors:\n// spec/screenplay/travellers.ts\n\nimport { protractor } from 'protractor';\nimport { Actor, BrowseTheWeb, Cast } from 'serenity-js/protractor';\n\nclass Travellers implements Cast {\n    actor(name: string): Actor {\n        return Actor.named(name).whoCan(BrowseTheWeb.using(protractor.browser));\n    }\n}\n\nTo learn more about how to define the custom cast of actors, find out more about the Stage.\nThe actors\nWith the stage in place, you can now put an actor into the spotlight.\nYou can do this by either creating an actor within the scope of an it block:\n// features/frequent_flyer_points-domestic_flights.ts\n\nimport { serenity } from 'serenity-js';\nimport { Travellers } from '../spec/screenplay/travellers.ts';\n\ndescribe('Earning Frequent Flyer points on domestic flights', () => {\n\n    const stage = serenity.callToStageFor(new Travellers());\n\n    describe('Flying in Economy class', () => {\n\n        it('earns standard points', () => stage.theActorCalled('James').attemptsTo(\n              /* perform tasks */\n        ));\n\n        // etc.\n    });                \n});\n\nOr, if there are some common tasks that need to be repeated for before or after several scenarios, you\ncould use Mocha's hooks, such as before, after, beforeEach and afterEach:\n// features/frequent_flyer_points-domestic_flights.ts\n\nimport { serenity } from 'serenity-js';\nimport { Travellers } from '../spec/screenplay/travellers.ts';\n\ndescribe('Earning Frequent Flyer points on domestic flights', () => {\n\n    const stage = serenity.callToStageFor(new Travellers());\n\n    describe('Flying in Economy class', () => {\n\n        beforeEach(() => stage.theActorCalled('James').attemptsTo(\n            /* perform setup tasks */\n        ));\n\n        it('earns standard points', () => stage.theActorInTheSpotlight().attemptsTo(\n              /* perform tasks */\n        ));\n\n        afterEach(() => stage.theActorInTheSpotlight().attemptsTo(\n            /* perform teardown tasks */\n        ));\n\n        // etc.\n    });                \n});\n\nSynchronisation\nAn important thing to note here is that a call to actor.attemptsTo(...) \nalways returns a Promise.\nSince Mocha is Promise-aware, we can return a promise from the function that defined the body of the test scenario,\nand Mocha will wait for it to be resolved:\nit('earns standard points', function () {\n    return stage.theActorCalled('James').attemptsTo(\n        /* perform tasks */\n    );\n});\n\nWe can also use a convenient fat arrow notation\nto make it more compact:\nit('earns standard points', () => stage.theActorCalled('James').attemptsTo(\n    /* perform tasks */\n));\n\nWith the attempsTo in place you can now give the actor some Tasks \nor assertions to perform!\n\nYour feedback

Pattern","keywords":"","body":"The Screenplay Pattern\nThe Screenplay Pattern is a user-centred model,\nwhich helps you shift the focus of automated acceptance tests from low-level interactions with the system\nto thinking about who the users of your system are, \nwhat is that they want to achieve by their interaction with your system\nand how exactly they're going to do it.\nThe Serenity/JS implementation of the Pattern focuses on making developers and testers more productive,\nby making acceptance test faster to write, cheaper to maintain and easier to scale to multiple projects and teams.\nThe Screenplay pattern is new to JavaScript but has been around for a while in various forms.\nIt was originally proposed by Antony Marcano in 2007. You can learn more about the origin and history of this model\nin \"Page Objects Refactored: SOLID Steps to the Screenplay Pattern\"\n(by Antony Marcano, Andy Palmer, John Ferguson Smart and Jan Molak) and at the end of this article.\nScreenplay by example\nExamples presented in this section are based on the project described in Beyond Page Objects: Next Generation Test Automation with Serenity and the Screenplay Pattern.\nThe best way to illustrate the Screenplay pattern is through a practical example.\nSuppose we are writing some tests for a Todo application like the one you can find\non the TodoMVC site.\nConsider the following scenario:\nFeature: Add new items to the todo list\n\n  As James (the just-in-time kinda guy)\n  I want to capture the most important things I need to do\n  So that I don’t leave so many things until the last minute\n\n  Scenario: Adding the first todo item\n\n    Given that James has an empty todo list\n     When he adds Buy some milk to his list\n     Then his todo list should contain Buy some milk\n\nLet's think about this scenario from a couple of different angles:\n\nWho is this for? What Role do they play?\nWhy are they here and what outcome do they hope for? What is their Goal?\nWhat will they need to do to achieve their goal? What Tasks do they need to perform?\nHow will they complete each task? How will their specific Interactions with the system look like?\n\nRole\nWe believe that the feature described in the above scenario will be useful to a \"just-in-time kinda guy\". \"James\" is a persona that we are using to understand this specific role.\nActor\nEach Role we discover needs an Actor to play it.\nIn Serenity/JS, an Actor is defined as follows:\nlet james = Actor.named('James');\n\nSuch Actor can perform Tasks:\njames.attemptsTo(\n    Start.withAnEmptyTodoList(),\n    AddATodoItem.called('Buy some milk')\n)\n\nand ask Questions about the state of the application in order to verify its correctness:\nexpect(james.toSee(TodoListItems.Displayed)).eventually.equal([ 'Buy some milk' ]);\n\nGoal\nThe Goal of an Actor is represented by the subject of the scenario:\nScenario: Adding the first todo item\n\nHere, James should be able to add the first todo item to his list.\nTask\nTasks represent high-level activities that an Actor needs to perform in order to achieve their Goal.\nTasks are named using the vocabulary of\nthe Problem Domain, such as:\n\"Pay with a default credit card\", \"Book a plane ticket\" or \"Add item to the basket\".\nA good example of a Task in our scenario could be to AddATodoItem.called('Buy some milk'),\nwhich mapped to a Cucumber.js step definition would look like this:\nthis.When(/^he adds (.*?) to his list$/, (itemName: string) => {\n    return james.attemptsTo(\n        AddATodoItem.called(itemName)\n    );\n});\n\nInteraction\nAn Interaction is a low-level activity directly exercising the Actor's Ability to interact\nwith a specific external interface of the system - such as a website, a mobile app or a web service.\nInteractions are named using the vocabulary of the\nSolution Domain, such as:\n\"Click a button\", \"Enter password into a form field\" or \"Submit JSON request\".\nActors should not exercise Interactions directly in the Cucumber step definitions. Instead, a group of one of more\nInteractions should be encapsulated and represented as a Task. For example:\n\nexport class Login implements Task {\n\n    performAs(actor: PerformsTasks) {\n\n        // The Login Task is composed of three Interactions:\n\n        return actor.attemptsTo(\n            Enter.theValue('James').into(LoginForm.Username_Field),\n            Enter.theValue('correct-horse-battery-staple').into(LoginForm.Password_Field),\n            Click.on(LoginForm.Submit_Button)\n        );\n    }\n}\n\nQuestion\nSimilarly to an Interaction, a Question directly exercises Actor's Ability to interact\nwith a specific external interface of the system - such as a website, a mobile app or a web service.\nAsking a Question results in a promise\nthat is eventually resolved to a specific value or a list of values.\nConsider a \"web question\" used in the example scenario:\nexport class TodoListItems {\n    static Displayed = Text.ofAll(TodoList.Items);\n}\n\nCalling Text.ofAll(...) returns a Question implementing the Question interface.\nWhen such question is applied to TodoList.Items defined as:\nexport class TodoList {\n    static Items = Target.the('List of Items').located(by.repeater('todo in todos'));\n}\n\nit eventually resolves to a list of strings, representing the text of the web elements matched by the TodoList.Items\nTarget.\nAll this means that we can have a Cucumber step defined as follows:\nthis.Then(/^.* todo list should contain (.*?)$/, (expectedItems: string) => {\n    let answer = james.toSee(TodoListItems.Displayed);\n\n    return expect(answer).to.eventually.equal(expectedItems);\n});\n\nor simply:\nthis.Then(/^.* todo list should contain (.*?)$/, (expectedItems: string) => {\n    return expect(james.toSee(TodoListItems.Displayed)).eventually.equal(expectedItems);\n});\n\nAbility\nIn order to interact with the system, an Actor needs Abilities, which encapsulate interface-specific clients.\nThose clients could be a web browser, a web service client, a mobile device driver and so on.\nBrowseTheWeb is a good example of an Ability that ships with Serenity/JS. To assign the Ability to an Actor:\nlet james = Actor.named('James').whoCan(BrowseTheWeb.using(protractor.browser);\n\nOnce the Actor has the Ability, it can be used in an Interaction,\nsuch as Click.on(LoginForm.Submit_Button):\nexport class Click implements Interaction {\n    public static on(target: Target): Click {\n        return new Click(target);\n    }\n\n    performAs(actor: PerformsTasks & UsesAbilities): PromiseLike {\n        return BrowseTheWeb.as(actor).locate(this.target).click();\n    }\n\n    constructor(private target: Target) { }\n}\n\nor a Question, such as Text.of(Address.Post_Code):\nexport class Text implements Question {\n\n    public static of(target: Target): Text {\n        return new Text(target);\n    }\n\n    answeredBy(actor: UsesAbilities): PromiseLike {\n        return BrowseTheWeb.as(actor).locate(this.target).getText();\n    }\n\n    constructor(private target: Target) {\n    }\n}\n\nThe Model\n\nThe Screenplay Pattern domain model,\nfrom \"Designing SOLID Actors\"\nby Jan Molak\nThe History\nIt all started at the Agile Alliance Functional Testing Tools workshop (AAFTT) back in 2007.\n\"In praise of abstraction\", a talk given by Kevin Lawrence, inspired Antony Marcano\nto implement a fluent DSL based on Kevin's idea to use the language of Interaction Designers\nto model the layers of abstraction in an acceptance test.\nWith the help of Andy Palmer, this fluent DSL is what became\nJNarrate a year later (2008).\nIn the late 2012, Antony and Andy joined forces with Jan Molak.\nTheir experiments with Kevin's model, combined with a desire to address problems with shortcomings of\nthe PageObject Pattern\nand apply SOLID design principles\nto acceptance testing is what became known in 2013\nas screenplay-jvm.\nIn 2015, when Antony, Andy and Jan started working with John Ferguson Smart,\nwhat became known as the Screenplay Pattern found its way into Serenity BDD,\na popular acceptance testing library written in Java.\nNow starting from 2016, you can use both the Screenplay Pattern and the powerful Serenity BDD reports on your JavaScript\nprojects thanks to Serenity/JS!\n\nYour feedback matters!\nSuggest features and improvements on github,\nget in touch on twitter,\nand if you found Serenity/JS useful - don't forget to give it a star!

Let's improve it.\nAliasing\nThe name of the expected element from the above example:\nitems => expect(items).to.eventually.include.('some item of interest');\n\ncould be made configurable:\nexpected => actual => expect(actual).to.eventually.include(expected);\n\nWe could also give the above function a name, and store it in our project as, say assertions.ts, so that\nit can be reused in other scenarios:\n// assertions.ts\nexport include = expected => actual => expect(actual).to.eventually.include(expected);\n\nWith this one-liner in place, we could improve the task definition from the previous example:\nimport { include } from './assertions.ts';\n\nactor.attemptsTo(\n    See.if(TodoList.Items_Available, include('some item of interest')),\n)\n\nDomain-specific assertions\nThe scenario where aliasing and domain-specific assertion can be very useful is in more complex domains,\nwhere you implement domain-specific questions. For example:\nSee.if(TradeConfirmation.Last_Trade, wasExecutedWithin(4, 'millis'))\n\nRetaining semantic meaning\nA regular chai assertion, such as this one:\nexpect(1 + 1).to.equal(2);\n\ndoes not retain any semantic meaning at runtime. If it fails - it throws an error, but it it passes, you won't notice it.\nHowever, audit or compliance reasons might require our tests to report \nthat a given assertion has been performed. \nIn those scenarios, the task to See can be wrapped in any regular task, annotated \nwith @step, so that it gets reported. For example:\nclass AccountILocked implements Task {\n\n    @step('{0} ensures that \\'#account\\' is locked and can no longer be modified')\n    performAs(actor: PerformsTasks): PromiseLike {\n        return actor.attemptsTo(\n            See.if(AccountStatus.of(this.account), isMarkedAs('locked')),\n        );\n    }\n\n    constructor(private account: string) {\n    }\n}\n\n PRO TIP: Wrapping an assertion into a task lets you execute it as part of any other task, \nfor example as a precondition.\nDelayed assertions\nSometimes an assertion needs to be performed against something that occured earlier on in the scenario\nand is no longer available.\nFor example, an actor is shown a popup with a voucher code that will be applied to their shopping basket\nshould they choose to subscribe to a newsletter. When the actor is ready for checkout, we'd like to assert that\nthe voucher they've been shown has been applied.\nThis scenario requires an actor, stateless by nature, to take note of what they've seen.\nFor this reason, we need to give the actor the following ability:\nimport { TakeNotes } from 'serenity-js/lib/screenplay';\n\nActor.named('Benjamin').whoCan(TakeNotes.usingAnEmptyNotepad());\n\nAn actor, of course, can have many abilities:\nActor.named('Benjamin').whoCan(TakeNotes.usingAnEmptyNotepad(), BrowseTheWeb.using(protractor.browser), /* etc */);\n\nWith the ability to TakeNotes in place, and some questions they can ask defined:\nexport class MarketingPopup {\n    static Voucher_Code = Text.of(Target.the('voucher code').located(by.id('newsletter-voucher')));\n}\n\nexport class Checkout {\n    static Applied_Vouchers = Text.ofAll(Target.the('applied vouchers').located(by.repeater('voucher in vouchers')))\n}\n\nand an include assertion like in the previous example, an actor can:\nactor.attemptsTo(\n    TakeNote.of(MarketingPopup.Voucher_Code),\n\n    /* ... perform other tasks */\n\n    CompareNotes.toSeeIf(Checkout.Applied_Vouchers, include, MarketingPopup.Voucher_Code),\n);\n\n\nYour feedback matters!\nSuggest features and improvements on github,\nget in touch on twitter,\nand if you found Serenity/JS useful - don't forget to give it a star! ★\nStar\n\n"},"community.html":{"url":"community.html","title":"Community events and articles","keywords":"","body":"Talks, meetups, articles\n If you've written an article, tutorial or a blog post, recorded a video, \nor are planning to talk about Serenity/JS at a meetup or a conference, please \nadd it to the list below\nto share the news with the community!\nEvents\n\n2017-11-08, Angular Connect, London, UK\"Testing Angular apps.
